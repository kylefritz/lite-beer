#Lite Beer

An automated beverage lifter built with blood, sweat and, arduino.

##Description

Original design at the first annual baltimore hackathon.

The system consists of a drinking cup attached to a metal arm which is
then connected to servos and then attached to the armrest of a chair.
With a button press, the system will rotate the metal arm to be in front
of the user with one servo, and then will raise the cup with two other
stronger servos. With another button the arm returns to its resting
position.

The settings for the arm are programmable and persist through power
loss. Another button enters training mode, which steps through
programming all settings. A LED light indicates what is being
programmed, and a three-pole switch is used to turn that specific motor
(or motors) each direction to adjust the arm in that axis.
